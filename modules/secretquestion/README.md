ADA Secret Question Module
-----------------------

This module will request a secret question and answer when registering a user.

**Please read carefully the effects of enabling this module!**

## Installing the module
Please run the provided ``db/ada_secretquestion_module.sql`` in the **common database**.

## Enabling the module
Copy the provided module's ``config/config_DEFAULT.inc.php`` to  ``config/config.inc.php``.
To enable the module, the ``config.inc.php`` file **must** ``return true;`` , please not that the provided default config file already does this.

## Effects on registration process

When this module is enabled, the email field of the registration form is no longer mandatory.
This means that the user might not have a valid email and will therefore not receive any email!

Furthermore, the following fields are added to the registration form:

Input name | Used for...
------- | ----------------
uname | displaying the username, generated by name and surname concatenation
upass | asking the registering user for a **required** password
secretquestion | asking the registering user a **required** secret question to be used by the forgot password feature
secretanswer | asking the registering user a **required** answer to the above question

**NOTE**: when registering a user with this module enabled, ADA will not send any email at all asking for user confirmation
and the user will be saved with the status of `ADA_STATUS_REGISTERED`.

## Effects on forgot password feature

The user will be asked for a username, and if one is found with an associated secret question, that question will be asked.
If the user answer is correct, then the module will generate a ``TokenForPasswordChange`` and redirect to the ``forget.php`` page using that token to authorize the password change.

**NOTE**: use the ``SECRETQUESTION_CI_ANSWER`` define in module's config file to tell if the answer check must use a case-insensitive compare.
